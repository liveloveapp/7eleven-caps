Do you ever feel like your strings just aren't unique enough? Want to stand out in a crowd of all-uppercase or all-lowercase words? Look no further, because 7ELEVEn-CAPs is here to help!

This TypeScript library exports a single function that will capitalize your string in the same way as the convenience store chain 7-Eleven: the first letter of each word is uppercase, and the last letter is lowercase. Finally, your strings can be just as cool as a Big Bite hotdog and a Slurpee combined!

## Usage

```ts
import CAPITALIZe from "7eleven-caps";

const input = "this is a string";
const output = CAPITALIZe(input);
console.log(output); // "THIs Is A STRINg"
```
